# College Prediction System

The College Prediction System is a web application built with Flask that predicts the best-suited college for a student based on their academic performance and preferences. The application utilizes machine learning algorithms to make accurate predictions and provides a user-friendly interface for students to explore their options.

## Features

- User Registration and Authentication: Users can create an account and securely log in to the system using MongoDB for user data storage.
- College Prediction: Students can input their MHT-CET Rank,Merit score (percentile),category for admission,preferred branch, and the system will predict the most suitable colleges for them.
- Machine Learning Model: The underlying prediction model is trained on a large dataset of college admissions data, ensuring accurate and reliable predictions.
- User-Friendly Interface: The application provides a clean and intuitive user interface, making it easy for students to navigate and interact with the system.

## Technologies Used

- Flask: A lightweight Python web framework used for building the web application.
- MongoDB: A NoSQL database used for storing user data and authentication credentials.
- Machine Learning Libraries: Popular Python library scikit-learn for building and training the prediction model.
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Front-end technologies for creating the user interface.
